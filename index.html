                ProjectSin is my brainchild of a concept global brand. Ever since I got immersed in the digital domain, the thought of having my own brand as an individual also emerged.
                And so, in the mid months of 2019, ProjectSin was born. At first I struggled whether to name it ProjectSin or ProjectsIn (since it would give a subcontextual ring to it),
                but alas I kept my original plan. It would be the flagship brand for all the upcoming projects, and ventures.
                At first the concept was to furnish and to introduce myself as a digital artist. I tried to create my own style and shifting from traditional art to digital.
                As of today, it is still at its hatchling form. Manifesting that someday it would become one of the many known recognized brands worldwide.

                 Providing services for designs, data-encoding and VA roles.
                 Juggling with a day-job that pays as much as to get-by, I am now developing some skills in Web Development.
                 To strive for better living conditions, in terms of greater stipend, and to shift to a career that is considerably one of the good trends in the digital age.
                 I enjoy art and crafts. That's what has got me to digital painting and design. I love to create my own style and to also give some good stuff to others.
                 Music has to be one of the many things that I had enjoyed lately, although I didn't got interested at a young age, later on in life, I felt that it has taken up some great spots to my liking.
                 It started when I was in college. Early 2000's was an age of great music, although some may argue, still, I could say that music taste back then was good."

                to being a timekeeper on a small scale computer shop, and up to this point where the latter still has been working for.
                Thru these experiences, I've grown to  get accustomed to handing out services. So it ain't a problem that in the future, I would also extend my helping hand to you. And may we get to work hand-in-hand in the coming days."

        <p>Oh-yeah<br>
            Oh-yeah<br>
            So scared of breaking it<br>
            That you won't let it bend<br>
            And I wrote two hundred letters<br>
            I will never send<br>
            Sometimes these cuts<br>
            Are so much deeper then they seem<br>
            You'd rather cover up<br>
            I'd rather let them bleed<br>
            So let me be<br>
            And I'll set you free, oh-yeah<br>
            I am in misery<br>
            There ain't nobody<br>
            Who can comfort me, oh-yeah<br>
            Why won't you answer me?<br>
            The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah<br>
            Girl you really got me bad<br>
            You really got me bad<br>
            Now I'm gonna get you back<br>
            I'm gonna get you back<br>
            Your salty skin and how<br>
            It mixes in with mine<br>
            The way it feels to be<br>
            Completely intertwined<br>
            Not that I didn't care<br>
            It's that I didn't know<br>
            It's not what I didn't feel<br>
            It's what I didn't show<br>
            So let me be and I'll set you free<br>
            I am in misery<br>
            There ain't nobody<br>
            Who can comfort me, oh-yeah<br>

            You say your faith is shaken<br>
            And you may be mistaken<br>
            You keep me wide awake<br>
            And waiting for the sun<br>
            I'm desperate and confused<br>
            So far away from you<br>
            And I'm getting near<br>
            I don't care where I have to run<br>
            Why do you do<br>
            What you do to me, yeah<br>
            Why won't you answer me<br>
            Answer me, yeah<br>

                    I'd give it all away just to get you back<br>
                    And fake it, fake it I'll take what I can get<br>
                    Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?<br>
                    Try to stay awake but you can't forget<br>
                    Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,<br>

                    I'm never gonna leave this bed uh<br>

                    I must have been a fool<br>
                    To love you so hard for so long<br>
                    So much stronger than before but<br>
                    So much harder to move on<br>
                    And now the bitter chill of the winter still blows<br>
                    Through me like a plague<br>
                    Only to wake up with an empty bed<br>
                    On a perfect summer day (uh-uh, uh-uh)<br>
                    My world just feels so cold<br>

                    I could have done<br>
                    And it warms my soul when you let me know<br>

                    Unlike any touch I've ever known<br>
                    And I never thought about you much<br>
                    'Til I'm broken down and all alone<br>

                    Oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
                    Took it for granted when you lifted me up<br>
                    I'm asking for your help<br>
                    I am going through hell<br>
                    Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice<br>
                    You cut out all the noise<br>
                    And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now<br>
                    I'd kill if I could take you back<br>

                    I have been bound by the shackles of love<br>
                    And I don't mind if I die tied up<br>

                    You left your flowers in the backseat of my car<br>
                    The things we said and did have left permanent scars<br>
                    Obsessed depressed at the same time<br>
                    I can't even walk in a straight line<br>
                    I've been lying in the dark no sunshine<br>
                    No sunshine<br>
                    No sunshine<br>
                    She cries<br>
                    This is more than goodbye<br>
                    When I look into your eyes<br>
                    You're not even there<br>
                    It's just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    Oh yeah<br>
                    I can't believe that it's over<br>
                    (Just a feeling)<br>
                    (Just a feeling that I have)<br>
                    (Just a feeling)<br>
                    (Just a feeling that I have)<br>
                    You've hit your low<br>
                    You've lost control and you want me back<br>
                    You may not believe me but I gave you all I have<br>
                    Oh just confess that you're still mine<br>
                    I roll around in a bed full of tears and<br>
                    I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine<br>
                    No sunshine<br>
                    No sunshine<br>
                    She cries this is more than goodbye<br>
                    When I look into your eyes you're not even there<br>
                    It's just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    No I can't believe that it's over now baby<br>
                    (Just a feeling)<br>
                    (Just a feeling that I have)<br>
                    (Just a feeling)<br>
                    (Just a feeling that I have)<br>
                    So much to say<br>
                    It's not the way she does her hair<br>
                    It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes<br>
                    And in my darkest day when she refused to run away<br>
                    The love she tried so hard to save<br>
                    It's just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    It's just a feeling<br>
                    It's just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    Just a feeling<br>
                    Just a feeling that I have<br>
                    I can't believe that it's over<br>
                    (Just a feeling)<br>
                    (Just a feeling that I have)<br>
                    I can't believe that it's over<br>
                    (Just a feeling)<br>
                    (Just a feeling that I have)<br>
                    I can't believe that it's over yeah<br>

                <h2 id="runaway">Runaway</h2>
                <p>What am I supposed to do with this time?<br>
                    If there's so many holes, I stay afloat<br>
                    But I feel out of control<br>
                    So petrified, I'm petrified, mm<br>
                    What am I supposed to do to get by?<br>
                    Did I lose everything I need to survive?<br>
                    'Cause at 4 a.m. when the sweat sets in<br>
                    Did you get my message? Did it send?<br>
                    Or did you just get on with your life? Oh<br>
                    I'm takin' time to think and<br>
                    I don't think it's fair for us to<br>
                    Turn around, and say, "Goodbye"<br>
                    I have this feeling when I<br>
                    Finally, find the words to say<br>
                    But I can't tell you if you turn around<br>
                    And run away, run away<br>
                    What am I supposed to do with these clothes? (Clothes)<br>
                    It's my twisted way of keepin' you close (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)<br>
                    I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man<br>
                    Did you get my message? Did it send?<br>
                    Or do you get along on your own? Oh<br>
                    I'm takin' time to think and<br>
                    I don't think it's fair for us to<br>
                    Turn around, and say, "Goodbye"<br>
                    I have this feelin' when I<br>

                    But I can't tell you if you turn around<br>
                    And run away, run away<br>
                    And it breaks me down when I see your face<br>
                    You look so different but you feel the same<br>
                    And I do not understand<br>
                    I cannot comprehend<br>
                    The chills your body sends<br>
                    Why did it have to end?<br>
                    I'm takin' time to think and<br>
                    I don't think it's fair for us to<br>
                    Turn around, and say, "Goodbye"<br>
                    I have this feelin' when I<br>
                    Finally, find the words to say<br>
                    But I can't tell you if you turn around<br>
                    And run away, run away, oh-ooh<br>
                    I'm takin' time to think and<br>
                    I don't think it's fair for us to<br>

                    And run away, run away<br>
                    Runaway, runaway<br>
                    Turn around and<br>
                    Runaway, runaway<br>
                    Runaway, runaway<br>
                    But I can't tell you if you<br>
                    Runaway, runaway<br>
                    Turn around and runaway<br>

                <h2 id="goodbyes">Out of Goodbyes</h2>
                <p>Tell me actions speak louder<br>
                    But there's something about her words, that hurt<br>
                    Closing up and it's so late and<br>
                    I'm the last one still waiting for ya, to lock the door<br>
                    On our way home I realize<br>
                    There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes<br>
                    Only veiled by a thin disguise<br>
                    Now that I've done my time<br>
                    I need to move on and I need you to try<br>
                    'Cause we're out of goodbyes<br>
                    We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes<br>
                    Never asked you to change<br>
                    But sadly, you don't feel the same, about me<br>
                    I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand<br>
                    Like this man<br>
                    On our way home I realize<br>
                    There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes<br>
                    Only veiled by a thin disguise<br>
                    Now that I've done my time<br>
                    I need to move on and I need you to try<br>
                    'Cause we're out of goodbyes (out of goodbyes)<br>
                    We're out of goodbyes (out of goodbyes)<br>
                    We're out of goodbyes (out of goodbyes)<br>
                    Oh, ooh</p><br>
